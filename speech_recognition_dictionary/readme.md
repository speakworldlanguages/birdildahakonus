This directory contains the vocabulary of the target language that the user is trying to learn by listening to the words and phrases first and then speaking into the microphone to try and see if he or she can say them too.

**What to do in order to forgive mispronunciations, be lisp friendly and to handle misrecognitions:**
1. Add all the other words that sound similar to human ear. (Like "Ice cream" vs "I scream")
2. Add all the other words that could be misrecognized by the computer. (Test and see what gets misrecognized as what)
