In Hito language (aka Japanese) some words may take the honorific prefix [o-]. It is usually used for things that are associated with human survival or public well being. Remember that only after becoming familiar with the Hitoic culture can you know exactly when to and when not to use [o-]. As for speech input, you may speak into your microphone either with or without [o-]; both are OK.
