In Hito language (aka Japanese) some words may take the honorific prefix [o-]. The prefix [o-] does not change the meaning of a word. Generally speaking, it is usually used with things that are especially important for survival. Remember that only after becoming familiar with the Hitoic culture can you know exactly when to and when not to use [o-]. Both forms (o- added or o- omitted) are OK when you speak into your microphone.
