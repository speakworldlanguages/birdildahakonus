Tonality is important in every language but when speaking Ren language (Chinese) it's more like “constant singing”. You will see that words can turn into totally different words just by changing (raising or lowering) the pitch of your voice. It may take a while until you get used to this “singing”. Remember that listening to vowels and consonants won't be enough as you must always pay attention to the type of the intonation too.
