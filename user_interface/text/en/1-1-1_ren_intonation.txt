All spoken languages on Earth feature tonality which helps people better express their mood or lets them emphasize that which is more important. However when speaking Renmen language (a.k.a. Chinese) tonality does a lot more; it gives words totally different meanings. Remember that you must pay attention to the intonation (raising or lowering the pitch of your voice) in every syllable until you get used to this “nonstop singing”.
