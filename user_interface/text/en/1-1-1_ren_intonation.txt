Every language on Earth makes use of tonality to better express the speaker’s mood or for emphasis. However when speaking Renmen language (Chinese) it's more than that; words will have totally different meanings just by changing (raising or lowering) the pitch of your voice. Remember that you must pay attention to the intonation in every syllable until you get used to this “nonstop singing”.
