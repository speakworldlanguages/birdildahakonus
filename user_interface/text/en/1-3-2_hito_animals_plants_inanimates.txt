When you talk about the presence and absence of things in Hito language, there are two words that both mean "There is" or "It exists".
<span style="white-space:nowrap; display:inline-block;">いる [iru]</span> is used for <strong>people and animals</strong> while <span style="white-space:nowrap; display:inline-block;">ある [aru]</span> is used for <strong>plants and inanimate things</strong>.
