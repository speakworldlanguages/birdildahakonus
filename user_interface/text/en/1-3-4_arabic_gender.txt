In Arabic, every noun is assigned a gender, either masculine or feminine, and this gender affects the forms of other words that interact with it in a sentence. While it may seem a bit challenging at first, with practice, you'll become more familiar with the gender of common nouns and how they influence the rest of the language's structure.
