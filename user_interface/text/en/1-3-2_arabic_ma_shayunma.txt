Even though the word for "water: ماء " and the word for "what: ما " in Arabic may sound similar, their pronunciations aren't exactly the same.
When you say ماء (which means <i>water</i>) you bring your voice to a halt by suddenly holding your breath.
When you say ما (which means <i>what</i>) you exhale naturally without any instantaneous stopping.
