In Kishi language (a.k.a. Turkish) there are "rules of harmony" by which vowels and consonants get modified for ease of pronunciation as well as fluency in one's utterance. You will now hear two forms of the same "with" particle; which are the attached pronunciation and the detached pronunciation i.e. with and without the harmony.
