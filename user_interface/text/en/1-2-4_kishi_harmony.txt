In Kishi language (a.k.a. Turkish) there are "rules of harmony" by which vowels and consonants get modified for ease of pronunciation and also for maximum fluency in one's utterance. The "WITH" particle will follow the "rules of harmony" whenever it is attached to a word as a suffix. But if it is detached then it is an independent word and "rules of harmony" don't apply. You will now hear two forms of the same "WITH" particle; the "attached" and the "detached" pronunciation i.e. with and without the harmony.
