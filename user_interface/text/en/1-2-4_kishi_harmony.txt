In Kishi language (a.k.a. Turkish) there are "rules of harmony" by which vowels and consonants are modified for concordance in one's utterance and easiness of pronunciation. You will now hear two forms of the same "with" particle; which are the attached pronunciation and the detached pronunciation i.e. with and without the harmony.
