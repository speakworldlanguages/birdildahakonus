There are many words in Hito language that were adopted from European languages. Better if you make sure that you are able to say them the way people in Hitoland (a.k.a. Japan) say them. Also bear in mind that you may occasionally encounter mutated forms where you will see that meanings of words have shifted in unpredictable ways.
