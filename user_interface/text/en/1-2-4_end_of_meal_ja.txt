ごちそうさま (go·chi·so·u·sa·ma) is often mistranslated as "Thank you for the meal". However the real meaning of <strong>gochisousama</strong> is,<blockquote>"We are hereby offering our regards to the spirits that have been created as a result of our having this good food together and here at this location their presence shall linger".</blockquote>(Note that even among natives few are aware of this fact and the common usage of the phrase is now mostly habitual)
