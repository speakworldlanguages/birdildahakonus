In Hito language (a.k.a. Japanese) names of things that are associated with human survival or public welfare can take an honorific prefix. That is why you sometimes hear the <span style="white-space:nowrap; display:inline-block;">お- [o-]</span> at the beginning of the Hito word for "water". Both forms are OK for the speaking test.
