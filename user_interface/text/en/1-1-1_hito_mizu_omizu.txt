In Hito language (a.k.a. Japanese) names of things that are associated with human survival or public welfare can take an honorific prefix. That is why you sometimes hear the <span style="white-space:nowrap; display:inline-block;">[o-]</span> at the beginning of the Hito word for "water". Now you may say it either with or without the <span style="white-space:nowrap; display:inline-block;">[o-] prefix;</span> the app will accept both.
