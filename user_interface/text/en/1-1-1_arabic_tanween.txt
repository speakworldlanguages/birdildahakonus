In standard Arabic, adding the <span style="white-space: nowrap;">[-n] sound</span> at the end of nouns is called "Tanween" or "Nunation". Tanween does not change the meaning of a word. Once you have seen enough many examples you will be able to know when to and when not to use tanween (we recommend letting it happen over time). At the end of this lesson, there will be a speaking test where you must talk to your device microphone. During the test you may say it either with or without Tanween; the app will accept both.
