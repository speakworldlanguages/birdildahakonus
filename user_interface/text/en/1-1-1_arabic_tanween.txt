In standard Arabic, adding the <span style="white-space: nowrap;">[-n] sound</span> at the end of nouns is called "Tanween" or "Nunation". Tanween does not change the meaning of a word. Once you have seen enough many examples you will be able to know when to and when not to use tanween (we recommend letting it happen over time). At the end of the lesson, speech recognition (i.e. talking to your device microphone) will accept both; you may say it either with or without Tanween.
