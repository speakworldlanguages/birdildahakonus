    // start() will now be able to start the timer as this.remainingTime won't be 0 anymore (it was set to 0 when timer completed)
    // -
    // What happens when reset() fires when timer is paused: As this.timeoutID will still exist after pause() executes, reset() will try to clear the timer that has already been cleared. In JavaScript this is a safe practice.
    // NEVERTHELESS: Once reset() executes this.timeoutID will be null so neither pause() nor resume() will have any effect
    // start() will be able to take action as now this.startTime will be null
    // start() will now tick from the beginning as this.remainingTime value that was calculated by pause() will be discarded
    // -
    // What happens when start() fires after pause() but before reset() » This will have no effect as this.remainingTime will still be a nonzero value
    // -
    // What happens when reset() fires after the timer is complete: All properties will return back to their defaults
    // start() will be able to create a fresh new timeout which then will tick from the beginning
    // -
    // What happens when start() fires after the timer is complete i.e. without reset()
    // start() will have no effect as (this.remainingTime === 0 || this.startTime) will evaluate to (true || true)
    // Can this.remainingTime equal to 0 while this.startTime is null or false? As of April 2024 it looks like the answer is NO.
    // BECAUSE: Only the reset() method modifies this.startTime and sets it to null but at the same time it sets this.remainingTime back to this.delay which is a nonzero value
