This directory contains the javascript libraries created by talented coders who kindly shared their work on GitHub. Our web application depends on the following.

* [annyang](https://github.com/TalAter/annyang)
* [devicedetector](https://github.com/PoeHaH/devicedetector)
* [ua-parser-js](https://github.com/faisalman/ua-parser-js)
* [howler](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js)
* [wavesurfer](https://github.com/katspaugh/wavesurfer.js)

Note: Even though devicedetector is pasted into js_for_every_single_html.js it is still used by the service worker in importScript devicedetector-min.js.
